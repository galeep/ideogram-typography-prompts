# Ideogram Typography Prompts

## Welcome
This place is for anyone who loves old styles of writing, calligraphy and typography, and wants to make art with AI. We use [Ideogram.ai](https://ideogram.ai) to create new images inspired by different kinds of writing throughout history,

## What's Here
In this repository, find a set of instructions (prompts) that help the AI make images with historical styles of writing.

## Relationship with Ideogram
This repository operates independently and is not officially associated with Ideogram.ai. Our work is driven by appreciation for their technology and its impact on digital art. (Ideogram, [please don't sue us](LEGAL.md)! üôè)

## How to Use These Prompts
Using the style tags `typography` and `conceptual art` can give great results. For more help, see Ideogram's guide on making advanced prompts, or talk to other Ideogram users on the [Ideogram Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ideogram).

## Talk to Others
You can talk to other people who like Ideogram on the [Ideogram Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ideogram). This is where the big conversations happen. This repository is just to help collect a list of good prompts for historical writing and typography.

## Be Creative and Respectful
When using these prompts, please remember to follow the rules. Don't use someone else's work without permission. And if you do, give credit where it's due.

## Licensing: The Simple Version
You can change and use any single prompt you find here. The rules for using lots of them, or the whole list, are in [another document](LEGAL.md). Each prompt is free to use, and the license does not change anything about your art or how you use your creations.

## The Code of Conduct Is Coming
We don‚Äôt have a complete set of rules yet. But we are working on it. We want this to be a place where people are nice and professional to each other.

Now, let's make some amazing typographic AI art. Enjoy these prompts and create something incredible!
