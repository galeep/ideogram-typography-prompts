# Ideogram Typography Prompts

Welcome to our dedicated space for calligraphy and typography, crafted for Ideogram AI enthusiasts. This repository is focused on the exploration of historical and modern scripts.

## About

This repository houses a collection of prompts for those intrigued by the fusion of traditional calligraphy with AI-driven art. Our aim is to provide a platform for sharing detailed prompts that span various eras and styles.

## Contribution

Before adding a prompt here, please discuss it on the [Ideogram Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ideogram). This ensures that each prompt is well-vetted and refined through community input. Contributions should be structured and clear, enriching our diverse selection.

## Relationship with Ideogram

This repository operates independently and is not officially associated with Ideogram.ai. We are a group of admirers who appreciate the platform's capability to merge art with technology.

## Usage Tips

For detailed instructions on effective prompt creation and understanding Ideogram's capabilities, refer to the [Ideogram Advanced Prompting documentation](https://docs.ideogram.ai/usage/advanced-prompting/style-tags). This resource is invaluable for both beginners and experienced users.

For optimal results with historical calligraphy and typography prompts, we've observed that combining `typography` and `conceptual art` style tags in Ideogram can be particularly effective. Your experiences may vary, and we encourage exploration. Tell the community what you find!

## Guidelines

All prompts here are intended for personal exploration and experimentation on letterforms. Respect for artistic integrity and copyright laws is paramount. 

## Community Engagement (needs deduping)

This repository serves as a niche archive for enthusiasts of typography, historical texts and calligraphy prompts. Community engagement and discussion belong on the Ideogram Discord.

The Ideogram Community Discord is the central hub for discussions about prompts and related topics. Join the vibrant discussions and gain insights on prompt creation at the [Ideogram Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ideogram). Ideogram's Discord is the primary hub for the Ideogram community: collaborative discussions, sharing ideas, and refining prompts.

## Contact

## Conduct (needs section depth fixes?) 

## Be Nice

Many things are legal but still rude. A community thrives on mutual respect and integrity. When using this repository and Ideogram's platform, we urge you to follow not just the letter of the guidelines but the spirit as well.

### Remixing and Sharing

It's common to find inspiration in others' work, but there's a fine line between being inspired and outright copying. If you remix or adapt someone else's creation, acknowledge it. A simple 'like' on the original or credit where it's due can go a long way. Before using someone else's work as a base for your commercial project, think about the effort they put into it. Fair play makes our community stronger.

### Respect and Courtesy

Our policy is straightforward: treat others as you'd like to be treated. Whether it's giving feedback, sharing prompts, or discussing ideas, always approach with kindness and respect. Remember, behind every creation is a person who's put time and effort into their work.

## Looking Forward

This project is nascent and does not have a Code of Conduct. We will adhere to Ideogram community guidelines; most interaction should take place in Ideogram's space and not this little notepad. We are primarily concerned with conduct around contributions to this collection specifically. As we grow, we will develop guidelines that reflect our commitment to a supportive and respectful environment. Your actions and interactions play an important role in shaping this space.

### Using Prompts from This Repository

Once you choose a prompt from this list, you're free to use it as you see fit for your projects on Ideogram or elsewhere. There are no restrictions on using these individual rompts. However, if you wish to use the entire list or a substantial part of it, please remember to credit this repository, as per the BSD 3-Clause License. This license governs the list as a compiled work, ensuring proper acknowledgment for the collection, while giving you freedom with individual prompts. It has absolutely no impact on your images.

### Umm, wat?
"This license is like saying 'You can use and share this big list of prompts, and even change or sell it if you want, but please tell everyone that we made it.' It's important to give credit to the people who created the list, especially if you use a lot of it. But if you just take one or two ideas for your own projects, that's totally fine – you don't have to say where you got those few ideas from."

Remember, any artwork you create using these prompts is your own.
